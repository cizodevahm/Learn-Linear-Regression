# Linear Regression
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression with one and multiple variables. The notebook includes data loading, data visualization, cost function computation, gradient descent, and plotting the results.

## Files
- `Linear Regression.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of Linear Regression.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cizodevahm/Learn-Linear-Regression
    ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd Learn-Linear-Regression
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Linear Regression.ipynb
    ```

## Implementation Details
- **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded from a text file and split into features (X) and target variable (y).
- **Data Visualization**: The data is plotted to visualize the relationship between the features and the target variable.
- **Cost Function**: The cost function is computed to measure the accuracy of the hypothesis.
- **Gradient Descent**: Gradient descent is implemented to minimize the cost function and find the optimal parameters.
- **Plotting Results**: The results are plotted to visualize the best-fit line and the convergence of the cost function.
- **Multiple Variables**: The notebook also includes an implementation of linear regression with multiple variables, demonstrating how to handle multiple features in the dataset.
